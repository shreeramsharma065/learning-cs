# 🚀 My Computer Science Learning Roadmap (12 Months)

This repository documents my journey to learn **Computer Science from scratch to advanced**,  
focusing on both **Python (high-level)** and **C (low-level)** programming.

---

## 📅 Timeline

### **Phase 0 — Setup (Week 0)**
- Install Python, GCC, VS Code, Git.
- Create repo `learning-cs`.
- Push “Hello World” in Python & C.

---

### **Phase 1 — Python Foundations (Weeks 1–12)**
- **Month 1 (Weeks 1–4)**: Python basics → loops, functions, OOP.  
  ✅ Mini projects: Calculator, To-Do CLI app.  
- **Month 2 (Weeks 5–8)**: Data structures & algorithms in Python.  
  ✅ Mini projects: Sorting & Searching library.  
- **Month 3 (Weeks 9–12)**: Math, Computer Architecture, OS basics.  
  ✅ Mini project: Multithreaded downloader.

---

### **Phase 2 — Core CS with Python (Weeks 13–24)**
- **Month 4**: Trees & Graphs → BFS, DFS.  
  ✅ Project: Maze solver.  
- **Month 5**: Databases → SQL + Flask/Django.  
  ✅ Project: Blog/Notes app with DB.  
- **Month 6**: OS & Networking.  
  ✅ Project: Python chat app (sockets).

---

### **Phase 3 — C Programming & Systems (Weeks 25–36)**
- **Month 7**: C fundamentals → pointers, memory, strings.  
  ✅ Project: Dynamic array library.  
- **Month 8**: Data structures in C → linked lists, stacks, queues.  
  ✅ Project: `ds.c` library.  
- **Month 9**: OS in C → processes, threads, file I/O.  
  ✅ Project: Multithreaded file processor.

---

### **Phase 4 — Advanced Integration (Weeks 37–52)**
- **Month 10**: Algorithms → greedy + DP.  
  ✅ Project: Knapsack solver (C + Python).  
- **Month 11**: Cloud & DevOps → Docker, CI/CD, Deployment.  
  ✅ Project: Dockerized Flask app.  
- **Month 12**: Capstone Project.  
  ✅ Options:  
    - Mini shell in C  
    - HTTP server in C  
    - Hybrid Flask app with C extension  

---

## 📊 Weekly Routine
- **Weekdays (1.5–2 hrs/day)**:  
  - 45 mins → DSA/reading.  
  - 45 mins → coding practice.  
  - 30 mins → project work / notes.  

- **Weekends (4–6 hrs)**:  
  - Focused project building.  
  - Write README & push commits.  
  - Review weekly progress.  

---

## ✅ Deliverables by End of 12 Months
- **6–8 solid projects** (Python apps + C systems).  
- **~100 solved algorithm problems**.  
- Comfort in both **Python (high-level)** and **C (low-level)**.  
- One **Capstone system project in C** + one **Deployed Python app**.  
- Well-documented GitHub portfolio.
